It has to be said.</b> While new coins are use low amounts of energy, the behemoths of Bitcoin and Ethereum use <b>hundreds of kilawatt hours per transaction.</b> This translates to a large carbon footprint for anyone using these cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <p className="text-justify text-xl">While it’s hard to change what’s already in place, there’s one prominent way to use use these cryptos mindfully: <b>carbon offsetting.</b> Through worldwide projects, you can offset your carbon by <b>paying just a little bit</b> to plant trees and install renewable energy. This way, you can better the world while continuing to reap the benefits of crypto.</p>
